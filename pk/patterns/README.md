| [Adapter](adapter-design-pattern) | Match interfaces of different classes
| [Bridge](bridge-design-pattern) | Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation | [Composite](composite-design-pattern) | A tree structure of simple and composite objects
| [Decorator](decorator-design-pattern) | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
| [Facade](facade-design-pattern) | A single class that represents an entire subsystem
| [Flyweight](flyweight-design-pattern) | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
