## Patterns

| Creational Patterns |  |
|--|--|
| [Abstract Factory](abstractFactory) | Creates an instance of several families of classes
| [Builder](#) | Separates object construction from its representation
| [Factory Method](#) | Creates an instance of several derived classes
| [Prototype](#) | A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
| [Singleton](#) | A class of which only a single instance can exist

| Structural Patterns |  |
|--|--|
| [Adapter](adapter-design-pattern) | Match interfaces of different classes
| [Bridge](bridge-design-pattern) | Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation | [Composite](composite-design-pattern) | A tree structure of simple and composite objects
| [Decorator](decorator-design-pattern) | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
| [Facade](facade-design-pattern) | A single class that represents an entire subsystem
| [Flyweight](flyweight-design-pattern) | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
| [Proxy](proxy-design-pattern) | An object representing another object

| Behavioral Patterns |  |
|--|--|
| [Chain of Resp.](chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern) | A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
| [Command](command-design-pattern) | Encapsulate a command request as an object
| [Interpreter](interpreter-design-pattern) | A way to include language elements in a program
| [Iterator](iterator-design-pattern) | Sequentially access the elements of a collection
|[Mediator](mediator-design-pattern) | Defines simplified communication between classes
| [Memento](memento-design-pattern) | Capture and restore an object's internal state
| [Observer](observer-design-pattern) | A way of notifying change to a number of classes
| [State](state-design-pattern) | Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
| [Strategy](strategy-design-pattern) | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
| [Template Method](template-method-design-pattern) | Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
| [Visitor](visitor-design-pattern) | Defines a new operation to a class without change
